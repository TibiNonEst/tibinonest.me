# Hiya ðŸ‘‹, I'm tibs!

I'm a queer and nonbinary software developer and system administrator.
I use they/them pronouns, see my [pronouns.page](https://en.pronouns.page/@tibs) for more info.
You may also see me online as TibiNonEst, the vestiges of an old username.


I don't particularly like talking about myself, but I guess you're here for a reason so here goes!

I am a developer on the build tools team and member of the community team and [QuiltMC](https://quiltmc.org), where I co-run our monthly development updates.
Outside of Quilt, I am also a member of a myriad of development teams, including [ProxyFox](https://proxyfox.dev), [WispLang](https://github.com/WispLang), [Debuggy](https://github.com/DebuggyTeam), [Helix Launcher](https://helixlauncher.dev), [Sweet Berry Collective](https://github.com/Sweet-Berry-Collective), and [DuvetMC](https://github.com/DuvetMC).
I have experience in a number of programming languages, but these days find myself working mainly in Java, Rust, Kotlin, or Typescript.
I have worked on a few major projects over the years, namely my Minecraft mod Cauldron Dyeing and the official Quilt build tool Loom (and soon QuiltGradle), you can learn more about these and others below.
Outside of development, I play a few instruments, some better some worse, and am very involved in the theater scene at my school.


## Current projects
- [**QuiltGradle:**]() Coming soon to an IDE near you!
- [**Cauldron Dyeing:**](https://modrinth.com/mod/cauldron-dyeing) A Minecraft mod that adds Bedrock's cauldron-based dyeing to Java.

## System administration
I have been hosting my own servers for everything from gaming to websites for the better part of 5 years.
Over this time I have learned quite a few things about what to, and what not to do in system administration.
I currently run two cloud servers, one acting as a Wireguard hub through which I proxy all my traffic, and the other as a main host for my web services, both running Alpine Linux.
The latter includes my personal git server, available at [git.tibinonest.me](https://git.tibinonest.me), and maven, at [maven.tibinonest.me](https://maven.tibinonest.me).
Additionally, I host many Minecraft servers on a local machine, with their traffic proxied through my Wireguard server to maintain privacy.
Most of these servers are just between friends, but for a while I hosted the [Unofficial Quilt Minecraft Server](https://modrinth.com/modpack/uqm).


## Music
I have spent the majority of my life surrounded by and playing music.
My main instrument is violin, which I have been playing for almost 13 years now.
I also dabble in piano, guitar, ukulele, mandolin, and singing.
I would like to some day release my own music, but we'll see if that ever happens.


## Theater
I have worked on many theater productions in the past few years occupying a number of roles.
These have included: light board operator for two indie productions, sound board operator for an indie production, lighting designer for two indie productions, co-lighting designer and violinist for a production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, violinist for a production of Legally Blond, and stage manager for a production of Chicago.


## Contact
The easiest ways to contact me would either be on Discord at `tibs#0001`, on [my Discord server](https://discord.tibinonest.me), or on the Fediverse at [tibs@blobfox.coffee](https://blobfox.coffee/@tibs).

I'm also available through email at [tibs@tibinonest.me](mailto:tibs@tibinonest.me), although that may take me a little bit longer to respond to.
