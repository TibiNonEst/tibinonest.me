# Hiya ðŸ‘‹, I'm tibs!

I'm a queer and nonbinary software developer and system administrator. I use they/them pronouns, see my
<a href="https://en.pronouns.page/@tibs" rel="me">pronouns.page</a> for more info. You may also see me online as
TibiNonEst, the vestiges of an old username.

I don't particularly like talking about myself, but I guess you're here for a reason so here goes!

I am an administrator and developer at [QuiltMC](https://quiltmc.org), where I am a member of the infrastructure and
build tools team, the latter of which I lead. Outside of Quilt, I am also a member of a myriad of development teams,
including[ProxyFox](https://proxyfox.dev), [WispLang](https://github.com/WispLang),
[Debuggy](https://github.com/DebuggyTeam), [Helix Launcher](https://helixlauncher.dev),
[Sweet Berry Collective](https://github.com/Sweet-Berry-Collective), [Vulpark](https://github.com/vulpark), and
[DuvetMC](https://github.com/DuvetMC). I have experience in a number of programming languages, but these days find
myself working mainly in Java, Rust, Kotlin, or Typescript. I have worked on a few major projects over the years, namely
my Minecraft mod Cauldron Dyeing and the official Quilt build tool Loom (and soon QuiltGradle), you can learn more about
these and others below. Outside of development, I play a few instruments, some better some worse, and have been very
involved in the theater scene at my school.


## Current projects

  edge storage.

## System administration
I have been hosting my own servers for everything from gaming to websites for the better part of 5 years. Over this
time I have learned quite a few things about what to, and what not to do in system administration. I currently run two
cloud servers, one acting as a WireGuard hub through which I proxy all my traffic, and the other as a main host for my
web services, both running Alpine Linux. The latter includes my personal git server, available at
[git.tibinonest.me](https://git.tibinonest.me), and maven, at [maven.tibinonest.me](https://maven.tibinonest.me).
Additionally, I host many Minecraft servers on a local machine, with their traffic proxied through my WireGuard server
to maintain privacy. Most of these servers are just between friends, but for a while I hosted the
[Unofficial Quilt Minecraft Server](https://modrinth.com/modpack/uqm).

As mentioned previously, I am a member of the [QuiltMC](https://quiltmc.org)'s infrastructure team, where I develop and
maintain our [Cloudflare workers](https://github.com/QuiltMC/workers) (including our custom maven solution),
[Helm charts](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-helm-charts), [Meta API](https://github.com/QuiltMC/update-quilt-meta),
and other assorted projects.


## Music
I have spent the majority of my life surrounded by and playing music. My main instrument is violin, which I have been
playing for almost 13 years now. I also dabble in piano, guitar, ukulele, mandolin, and singing. I would like to some
day release my own music, but we'll see if that ever happens.


## Theater
I have worked on many theater productions in the past few years occupying a number of roles. These have included: light
board operator for two indie productions, sound board operator for an indie production, lighting designer for two indie
productions, co-lighting designer and violinist for a production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,
violinist for a production of Legally Blond, and stage manager for a production of Chicago.


## Contact
The easiest ways to contact me would either be on Discord directly at `tibs.gay` or on the Fediverse at
[tibs@blobfox.coffee](https://blobfox.coffee/@tibs).

I'm also available through email at [tibs@tibinonest.me](mailto:tibs@tibinonest.me), although that may take me a little
bit longer to respond to.
